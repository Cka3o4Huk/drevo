"Ice Project created for development and research base
for building large information systems or simple home pages.
The main aim is creating base used object-oriented model
for maximize performance of development. All for enjoyment! )

System will be contain database and application servers. Model of
database is object-oriented, i.e. it allow create objects of different
types with different parameters. All content of future system will be
save in DB. Application server (created with Java Technology =) ) will
be translate objects to understandable for user dates and GUI.

Main problem is performance of system. All operations such as
translation objects and working with DB must be realized by using
cache tables and other mechanisms."
